## Proj Construction

Assume that $R$ is an integral graded ring, finitely-generated over $R_{0} = \mathbb{C}$; such a ring $R = \mathbb{C}[x_{0},\ldots, x_{n}]/I$ corresponds to an irreducible affine variety $\mathcal{C}(X) = Spec(R) = V_{\mathbb{A}}(I) \subseteq \mathbb{A}^{n+1}$, where the subscript of $V_{\mathbb{A}}(I)$ stands for the affine or inhomogeneous. $\mathcal{C}(X)$ is called the (weighted homogeneous) _affine cone_ over the projective variety $V_{\mathbb{P}}(X) = X$, which is defined as the _homogeneous spectrum_:
$$
X = Proj(R) = V_{\mathbb{P}}(I) := (V_{\mathbb{A}}(I) - \{0\})/\mathbb{G}_{m} \subseteq \mathbb{P}(a_{0},\ldots,a_{n}),
$$
where the $a_{0},\ldots, a_{n} \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ are the weights of the $\mathbb{G}_{m}$-action on the coordinates $x_{0},\ldots, x_{n}$ of $\mathcal{C}(X)$.

::: remark Remark
In the case when $R_{0} = \mathbb{C}$ (or any other field for that matter), $Spec(R_{0}) = \{0\}$ and $Proj(R)$ can be also viewed as $Proj(R) = (Spec(R) - Spec(R_{0}))/\mathbb{G}_{m}$.

::: remark Remark
When $R$ is generated in degree one over $R_{0}$, then
$$
Proj(R) \cong \mathbb{P}(S)
$$
