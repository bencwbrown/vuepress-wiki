#### Closed Embeddings

A morphism of schemes $\varphi: Y \rightarrow X$ is a _closed embedding_ if every point $X \in X$ has an affine neighbourhood $U$ such that $\varphi^{-1}(U) \subset Y$ is an affine subscheme and the homomorphism $\psi_{U} : \mathcal{O}_{X}(U) \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{Y}(\varphi^{-1}(U))$ is surjective. In this case we say that $Y$ is a _closed subscheme_ of $X$.
