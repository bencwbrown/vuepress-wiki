##### Holomorphic Vector Bundle

Let $X$ be a complex manifold. A _holomorphic vector bundle_ of rank $r$ on $X$ is a complex manifold $E$ together with a holomorphic map
$$
\pi : E ‚ü∂ X
$$
along with the structure of an $r$-dimensional complex vector space on any _fibre_ $E_{x} := \pi^{-1}(x)$ satisfying the following condition:

There exists an open covering $X = \cup U_{i}$ and biholomorphic maps $\psi_{i} : \pi^{-1}(U_{i}) \cong U_{i} \times \mathbb{C}^{r}$ commuting with the projections to $U_{i}$ such that the induced map $\pi^{-1}(U_{i}) \cong \mathbb{C}^{r}$ is $\mathbb{C}$-linear.

A _holomorphic line bundle_ is a holomorphic vector bundle of rank one.
