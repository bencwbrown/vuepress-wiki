##### Graded $A$-algebra

Let $A$ be a ring. A _graded $A$-algebra_ is an $A$-algebra $R$ which is also a graded ring, i.e. if $r \in R_{d}$ then $ar \in R_{d}$ for all $a \in A$. That is to say that $R_{d}$ is an $A$-submodule of $R$ for each $d \geq 0$.

##### Cartesian Product

Let $A$ be a fixed ring, and let $R, S$ be graded $A$-algebras. Their _cartesian product_ $R \times_{A} S$ is the graded $A$-module defined to the sum of the images of the $A$-module morphism
$$
    R_{d} \otimes_{A} S_{d} \longrightarrow R \otimes_{A} S,\qquad \text{for all } d \geq 0.
$$
This is a graded $A$-subalgebra of $R\otimes_{A}S$, with the inherited grading
$$
    (R\times_{A}S)_{d} \cong R_{d} \otimes_{A} S_{d}
$$
for each $d \geq 0$.

::: lemma Lemma
Let $R, S$ be graded $A$-algebras. If $R$ is generated by elements $\{r_{i}\}\subseteq R_{1}$ as an $R_{0}$-algebra, and $S$ is generated by elements $\{s_{j}\}\subseteq S_{1}$ as an $S_{0}$-algebra, then $R \times_{A} S$ is generated by $\{ r_{i} \otimes s_{j} \} \subseteq (R \times_{A} S)_{1}$ as an $(R \times_{A} S)_{0}$-algebra.

##### Rees Algebra

For an ideal $I$ in a commutative ring $T$, the _Rees algebra_ $R[It]$ is defined to be
$$
    R[It] = \bigoplus_{n=0}^{\infty}I^{n}t^{n} \subseteq R[t]
$$
