On its own, this extra freedom gives rise to more than enough interesting phenomena, but it is the fact that weighted projective space arises naturally in the context of classical algebraic geometry that can be surprising. Using the Riemann-Roch theorem to calculate ℓ(E, nD) where E is a nonsingular cubic curve inside P2 and D = p ∈ E is a point we obtain a non-negatively graded ring R(E) = ⊕n 0L(E, nD).

  abstract = {Let \$X\$ be a projective variety with a torus action, which for simplicity we assume to have dimension 1. If \$X\$ is a smooth complex variety, then the geometric invariant theory quotient \$X//G\$ can be identifed with the symplectic reduction \$X\_r\$. Lerman introduced a construction (valid for symplectic manifolds) called symplectic cutting, which constructs a manifold \$X\_c\$, such that \$X\_c\$ is the union of \$X\_r\$ and an open subset \$X\_\{{$>$}0\} \textbackslash{}subset X\$. Moreover, there is a natural torus action on \$X\_c\$ such that \$X\_r\$ is a component of the fixed locus. Using localization for equivariant cohomology, this construction can be used to study of \$X\_r\$. In this note, we give an algebraic version of this construction valid for projective but possibly singular varieties defined over arbitrary fields. This construction is useful for studying \$X\_r\$ from the point of view of algebraic geometry, using the equivariant intersection theory developed by the authors. At the end of the paper we briefly give an adaptation of Lerman's proof of the Kalkman residue formula and use it to give some formulas for characteristic numbers of quotients by a torus.},

We provide an introduction to explicit methods in the study of moduli spaces of quiver representations and derived categories arising in toric geometry. The first main goal is to present the noncommutative geometric approach to semiprojective toric varieties via quivers. To achieve this, we use geometric invariant theory to construct both semiprojective toric varieties and moduli spaces of quiver representations. The second main goal builds on the first by presenting an introduction to explicit methods in derived categories of coherent sheaves in toric geometry. We recall the notion of tilting bundles with examples, and describe the McKay correspondence as a derived equivalence in some detail following Bridgeland, King and Reid. We also describe extensions of their result beyond the G-Hilbert scheme to other fine moduli spaces of bound quiver representations.},

  abstract = {Many classes of projective algebraic varieties can be studied in terms of graded rings. Gorenstein graded rings in small codimension have been studied recently from an algebraic point of view, but the geometric meaning of the resulting structures is still relatively poorly understood. We discuss here the weighted projective analogs of homogeneous spaces such as the Grassmannian Gr(2,5) and orthogonal Grassmannian OGr(5,10) appearing in Mukai's linear section theorem for Fano 3-folds, and show how to use these as ambient spaces for weighted projective constructions. This is a first sketch of a subject that we expect to have many interesting future applications.},

  shorttitle = {Flips in Low Codimension},
  abstract = {A flip is a birational map of 3-folds X- ---{$>$} X+ which is an isomorphism away from curves C- c X- and C+ c X+ and does not extend across these curves. Flips are the primary object of study of this thesis. I discuss their formal definition and history in Chapter 1.

Flips are well known in toric geometry. In Chapter 2, I calculate how the numbers K3 and χ(nK) differ between X- and X+ for toric flips. These numbers are also related in a primary way by Riemann-Roch theorems but I keep that quiet until Chapter 5.

In Chapter 3, I describe a technique, which I learned from Miles Reid, for constructing a flip as C* quotients of a local variety 0 E A, taken in different ways. The codimension of my title refers to the minimal embedding dimension of 0 E A. The case of codimension 0 turns out to be exactly the case of toric geometry as studied in Chapter 2. The main result of Chapter 3 classifies the cases when A c C5 is a singular hypersurface, that is, when A defines a flip in codimension 1.

Chapters 4 and 5 concern themselves with computing new examples of flips in higher codimension and studying changes in general flips. I indicate one benefit of knowing how these changes work.

The main results of Chapters 2 and 3 have been circulated informally as [2] and [3] respectively.},

We show that, in good cases, two such quotients are related by a flip in the sense of Mori, and explain the relationship with the minimal model program. Moreover, we express the flip as the blow-up and blow-down of specific ideal sheaves, leading, under certain hypotheses, to a quite explicit description of the flip. We apply these ideas to various familiar moduli problems, recovering results of Kirwan, Boden-Hu, Bertram-Daskalopoulos-Wentworth, and the author. Along the way we display a chamber structure, following Duistermaat-Heckman, on the space of all linearizations. We also give a new, easy proof of the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition theorem.},

  abstract = {In this article we review the question of constructing geometric quotients of actions of linear algebraic groups on irreducible varieties over algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero, in the spirit of Mumford’s geometric invariant theory (GIT). The article surveys some recent work on geometric invariant theory and quotients of varieties by linear algebraic group actions, as well as background material on linear algebraic groups, Mumford’s GIT and some of the challenges that the non-reductive setting presents. The earlier work of two of the authors in the setting of unipotent group actions is extended to deal with actions of any linear algebraic group. Given the data of a linearisation for an action of a linear algebraic group H on an irreducible variety X, an open subset of stable points Xs is defined which admits a geometric quotient variety Xs/H. We construct projective completions of the quotient Xs/H by considering a suitable extension of the group action to an action of a reductive group on a reductive envelope and using Mumford’s GIT. In good cases one can also compute the stable locus Xs in terms of stability (in the sense of Mumford for reductive groups) for the reductive envelope.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we show the equivalence between two seemingly distinct 2d TQFTs: one comes from the "Coulomb branch index" of the class S theory \$T[\textbackslash{}Sigma,G]\$ on \$L(k,1) \textbackslash{}times S\^1\$, the other is the \$\^LG\$ "equivariant Verlinde formula", or equivalently partition function of \$\^LG\_\{\textbackslash{}mathbb\{C\}\}\$ complex Chern-Simons theory on \$\textbackslash{}Sigma\textbackslash{}times S\^1\$. We first derive this equivalence using the M-theory geometry and show that the gauge groups appearing on the two sides are naturally \$G\$ and its Langlands dual \$\^LG\$. When \$G\$ is not simply-connected, we provide a recipe of computing the index of \$T[\textbackslash{}Sigma,G]\$ as summation over indices of \$T[\textbackslash{}Sigma,\textbackslash{}tilde\{G\}]\$ with non-trivial background 't Hooft fluxes, where \$\textbackslash{}tilde\{G\}\$ is the simply-connected group with the same Lie algebra. Then we check explicitly this relation between the Coulomb index and the equivariant Verlinde formula for \$G=SU(2)\$ or \$SO(3)\$. In the end, as an application of this newly found relation, we consider the more general case where \$G\$ is \$SU(N)\$ or \$PSU(N)\$ and show that equivariant Verlinde algebra can be derived using field theory via (generalized) Argyres-Seiberg duality. We also attach a Mathematica notebook that can be used to compute the \$SU(3)\$ equivariant Verlinde coefficients.},

In particular, this interpretation allows one to pose questions that would not have been asked otherwise, such as, "Is there a direct relation between Khovanov homology and the A-polynomial of a knot?" We will explain that the answer to this question is "yes," and introduce a certain deformation of the planar algebraic curve defined by the zero locus of the A-polynomial. This novel deformation leads to a categorified version of the Generalized Volume Conjecture that completely describes the "color behavior" of the colored sl(2) knot homology, and eventually to a similar version for the colored HOMFLY homology. Furthermore, this deformation is strong enough to distinguish mutants, and its most interesting properties include relations to knot contact homology and knot Floer homology.},

The transform intertwines the natural actions of U(p, q) and is injective if m ⩾ 0, so it provides a geometric realization of the ladder representations of U(p, q).

One type of problem that appears in many areas of mathematics, applied mathematics, physics, economics, and probably other sciences concerns the summing of the values of a function over a discrete set of points in a prescribed region of space. Slightly more precisely, let L be a lattice in Euclidean space ℝ n , such as the set of points with integral co-ordinates. Let S ⊂ ℝ n be a region, and let f be a (reasonable) function. Then how can one write (or approximate) the sum ∑n∊L∩S f(x) in terms of quantities that are continuous or continuously computed from f and the (static) geometry of the region S? For example, if f ≡ 1, one is asking for a computation of \#(L ∩ S), the number of lattice points in S, in terms of its geometry.},

We prove that these kinds of symbolic–algebraic ideas surpass the traditional branch-and-bound enumeration and in some instances LattE is the only software capable of counting. Using LattE, we have also computed new formulas of Ehrhart (quasi-)polynomials for interesting families of polytopes (hypersimplices, truncated cubes, etc). We end with a survey of other “algebraic–analytic” algorithms, including a “homogeneous” variation of Barvinok’s algorithm which is very fast when the number of facet-defining inequalities is much smaller compared to the number of vertices.},

Using equivariant versions of these operations, I show how classic symplectic results of convexity and classification of toric manifolds translate to the origami world. Several examples are presented, including a complete classification of toric origami surfaces. Furthermore, I extend the results above to the case of nonorientable origami manifolds.},

  abstract = {Suppose X is a compact symplectic manifold acted on by a compact Lie group K (which may be nonabelian) in a Hamiltonian fashion, with moment map μ: X → Lie(K)∗ and Marsden-Weinstein reduction MX = μ−1(0)K. There is then a natural surjective map κ0 from the equivariant cohomology H∗K(X) of X to the cohomology H∗(MX). In this paper we prove a formula (Theorem 8.1, the residue formula) for the evaluation on the fundamental class of MX of any η0ϵ H∗(MX) whose degree is the dimension of MX, provided that 0 is a regular value of the moment map μ on X. This formula is given in terms of any class ηϵ H∗K(X) for which κ0(η) = η0, and involves the restriction of η to K-orbits KF of components F ⊂X of the fixed point set of a chosen maximal torus T ⊂K. Since κ0 is surjective, in principle the residue formula enables one to determine generators and relations for the cohomology ring H∗(MX), in terms of generators and relations for H∗K(X). There are two main ingredients in the proof of our formula: one is the localization theorem [3,7] for equivariant cohomology of manifolds acted on by compact abelian groups, while the other is the equivariant normal form for the symplectic form near the zero locus of the moment map. We also make use of the techniques appearing in our proof of the residue formula to give a new proof of the nonabelian localization formula of Witten ([35, Section 2]) for Hamiltonian actions of compact groups K on symplectic manifolds X; this theorem expresses η0[MX] in terms of certain integrals over X.},

This isomorphism allows us to prove that hyperpolygon spaces X(α) undergo an elementary transformation in the sense of Mukai as α crosses a wall in the space of its admissible values. We describe the changes in the core of X(α) as a result of this transformation as well as the changes in the nilpotent cone of the corresponding moduli spaces of parabolic Higgs bundles. Moreover, we study the intersection rings of the core components of X(α). In particular, we find generators of these rings, prove a recursion relation in n for their intersection numbers and use it to obtain explicit formulas for the computation of these numbers. Using our isomorphism, we obtain similar formulas for each connected component of the nilpotent cone of the corresponding moduli spaces of parabolic Higgs bundles thus determining their intersection rings. As a final application of our isomorphism we describe the cohomology ring structure of these moduli spaces of parabolic Higgs bundles and of the components of their nilpotent cone.},

  url = {http://search.proquest.com/docview/1441337946/abstract/1E22961EC7DC41B3PQ/3},
  abstract = {Given a quasiprojective algebraic variety with a reductive group action, we describe a relationship between its equivariant derived category and the derived category of its geometric invariant theory quotient. This generalizes classical descriptions of the category of coherent sheaves on projective space and categorifies several results in the theory of Hamiltonian group actions on projective manifolds.
This perspective generalizes and provides new insight into examples of derived equivalences between birational varieties. We provide a criterion under which two different GIT quotients are derived equivalent, and apply it to prove that any two generic GIT quotients of an equivariantly Calabi-Yau projective-over-affine variety by a torus are derived equivalent.
We also use these techniques to study autoequivalences of the derived category of coherent sheaves of a variety arising from a variation of GIT quotient. We show that these autoequivalences are generalized spherical twists, and describe how they result from mutations of semiorthogonal decompositions. Beyond the GIT setting, we show that all generalized spherical twist autoequivalences of a dg-category can be obtained from mutation in this manner.
Motivated by a prediction from mirror symmetry, we refine the main theorem describing the derived category of a GIT quotient. We produce additional derived autoequivalences of a GIT quotient and propose an interpretation in terms of monodromy of the quantum connection. We generalize this observation by proving a criterion under which a spherical twist autoequivalence factors into a composition of other spherical twists.
Finally, our technique for studying the derived category of a GIT quotient relies on a special stratification of the unstable locus in GIT. In the final chapter we establish a new modular description of this stratification using the mapping stack from the quotient of the affine line by the multiplicative group to the quotient stack X/G. This is the first foundational step in extending the methods of GIT beyond global quotient stacks X/G to other stacks arising in algebraic geometry. We describe a method of constructing such stratifications for arbitrary algebraic stacks and show that it reproduces the GIT stratification as well as the classical stratification of the moduli stack of vector bundles on a smooth curve.},

We generalize the concept of second order real Dolbeault cohomololgy groups to almost complex structures. We prove it is indeed a direct sum decomposition in dimension 4. By this notion, we study the almost Kähler cone (or J-compatible cone) from various aspects. First, we obtain a comparison theorem on almost Kähler cone and J-tamed cone for any even dimension. In turn, we study the Nakai Moishezon type Theorem and Donaldson's “tamed to compatible” question for almost complex structures on rational surfaces. We also confirm Donaldson's question on complex surfaces.
Kodaira dimension is an important notion for complex manifolds. We confirm that the symplectic Kodaira dimension in dimension 4 is equal to the complex Kodaira dimension when the manifolds admit both structures. We also introduce 3-dimensional analogue and a relative version for symplectic manifolds in dimension 4 (and 2). By this notion, we confirm the Kodaira dimensions are additive in most interesting cases.},

The motivation for this is given by instanton counting, a recent development in theoretical physics that gives a direct approach to the non-perturbative study of certain super-symmetric quantum field theories. We develop a strategy for calculating the integrals using a combination of several techniques in symplectic geometry and equivariant cohomology. Most importantly we use an equivariant version of non-abelian localization, applied to the ADHM-construction of the moduli-spaces. Furthermore, we reduce the problem to a compact setting by means of varying compactifications using symplectic cuts, recovering the original integral over a non-compact space as the limit of integrals over compact spaces. In contrast with previous applications, in our case the contribution at infinity introduced by these compactifications turns out to be of primordial importance. We illustrate this method by explicitly calculating the volumes for moduli-spaces with low instanton number.},

{$<$}p{$>$}We first start in Chapter II with the simplest cases and demonstrate the extremely rich interplay between geometry and physics even when the manifold is just a direct product. In this particular case, by examining the problem from various vantage points, we generalize the celebrated relations between 1) the Verlinde algebra, 2) quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian, 3) quantization of Chern-Simons theory and 4) the index theory of the moduli space of flat connections to a completely new set of relations between 1) the "equivariant Verlinde algebra" for a complex group, 2) the equivariant quantum K-theory of the vortex moduli space, 3) quantization of complex Chern-Simons theory and 4) the equivariant index theory of the moduli space of Higgs bundles.{$<$}/p{$>$}

{$<$}p{$>$}In Chapter III we move one step up in complexity by looking at the next simplest three-manifolds---lens spaces. We test the 3d-3d correspondence for theories that are labeled by lens spaces, reaching a full agreement between the index of the 3d N=2 "lens space theory" and the partition function of complex Chern-Simons theory on the lens space.{$<$}/p{$>$} 

{$<$}p{$>$}The two different types of manifolds studied in the previous two chapters also have interesting interactions. We show in Chapter IV the equivalence between two seemingly distinct 2d TQFTs: one comes from the "Coulomb branch index" of the class S theory on a lens space, the other is the "equivariant Verlinde formula". We check this relation explicitly for SU(2) and demonstrate that the SU(N) equivariant Verlinde algebra can be derived using field theory via (generalized) Argyres-Seiberg dualities.{$<$}/p{$>$}

{$<$}p{$>$}In the last chapter, we directly jump to the most general situation, giving a proposal for the 3d-3d correspondence for an arbitrary Seifert manifold. We remark on the huge class of novel dualities relating different descriptions of the "Seifert theory" associated with the same Seifert manifold and suggest ways that our proposal could be tested.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This torus action shows that this set can be viewed symplectically as a (noncompact) toric variety. The number of integral points of the moment map for the torus action turns out to be identical to the Verlinde dimension D(g, k). As an application, we furnish a new proof of the relation between the large-k limit of D(g, k) and the volume of the moduli space. From our point of view, this relation follows from the equality between the symplectic volume of a toric variety and the Euclidean volume of the image of the moment map. Similar considerations are shown to give rise to the volumes of moduli spaces of parabolic bundles on a Riemann surface. Knowledge of these volumes has been shown to allow a proof of the Verlinde formula for the dimension of the space of holomorphic sections of line bundles on this space.},

  doi = {10.3842/SIGMA.2015.055},
  abstract = {A key result in equivariant symplectic geometry is Delzant’s classification of compact connected symplectic toric manifolds. The moment map induces an embedding of the quotient of the manifold by the torus action into the dual of the Lie algebra of the torus; its image is a unimodular (“Delzant”) polytope; this gives a bijection between unimodular polytopes and isomorphism classes of compact connected symplectic toric manifolds. In this paper we extend Delzant’s classification to non-compact symplectic toric manifolds. For a noncompact symplectic toric manifold the image of the moment map need not be convex and the induced map on the quotient need not be an embedding. Moreover, even when the map on the quotient is an embedding, its image no longer determines the symplectic toric manifold; a degree two characteristic class on the quotient makes an appearance. Nevertheless, the quotient is a manifold with corners, and the induced map from the quotient to the dual of the Lie algebra is what we call a unimodular local embedding. We classify non-compact symplectic toric manifolds in terms of manifolds with corners equipped with degree two cohomology classes and unimodular local embeddings into the dual of the Lie algebra of the corresponding torus. The main new ingredient is the construction of a symplectic toric manifold from such data. The proof passes through an equivalence of categories between symplectic toric manifolds and symplectic toric bundles over a fixed unimodular local embedding. This equivalence also gives a geometric interpretation of the degree two cohomology class.},

For the minimal choice of the holonomy, the resulting 3d TQFTs are non-unitary and semisimple, thus distinguishing themselves from theories of Chern-Simons and Rozansky-Witten types respectively. Changing the holonomy performs a Galois transformation on the TQFT, which can sometimes give rise to more familiar unitary theories such as the \$(G\_2)\_1\$ and \$(F\_4)\_1\$ Chern-Simons theories. Our construction is based on an intriguing relation between topologically twisted partition functions, wild Hitchin characters, and chiral algebras which, when combined together, relate Coulomb branch and Higgs branch data of the same 4d \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{N\}=2\$ theory. We test our proposal by applying localization techniques to the conjectural \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{N\}=1\$ UV Lagrangian descriptions of the \$(A\_1,A\_2)\$, \$(A\_1,A\_3)\$ and \$(A\_1,D\_3)\$ theories.},

The main technical tool we employ is Morse theory with moment maps. We prove a Lojasiewicz inequality which permits the use of Morse theory in the non-compact setting. We use this to deduce Kirwan surjectivity for an interesting class of non-compact quotients, and obtain a new proof of hyperk\textbackslash{}"ahler Kirwan surjectivity for hypertoric varieties. We then turn our attention to quiver varieties, obtaining an explicit inductive procedure to compute the Betti numbers of the fixed-point sets of the natural S\^1 -action on these varieties. To study the kernel of the Kirwan map, we adapt the Jeffrey-Kirwan residue formula to our setting. The residue formula may be used to compute intersection pairings on certain compact subvarieties, and in good cases these provide a complete description of the kernel of the hyperk\textbackslash{}"ahler Kirwan map. We illustrate this technique with several detailed examples. Finally, we investigate the Poisson geometry of a certain family of Nakajima varieties. We construct an explicit Lagrangian fibration on these varieties by embedding them into Hitchin systems. This construction provides an interesting class of toy models of Hitchin systems for which the hyperk\textbackslash{}"ahler metric may be computed explicitly.},

As a result we find that the hyperK¨ahler moment in these cases has connected fibres, a property that is true for symplectic moment maps, and is surjective. New examples of hypertoric manifolds of infinite topological type are produced. We provide examples of non-Abelian tri-Hamiltonian group actions of connected groups on complete hyperK¨ahler manifolds such that the hyperK¨ahler moment map is not surjective and has some fibres that are not connected.

For example, we may compute a global integral by summing integrals at each of the fixed points. Or, if we know that the global integral is zero, we conclude that the sum of the local integrals is zero. This often turns topological questions into combinatorial ones and vice versa. This expository article features several instances of localization that occur at the crossroads of symplectic and algebraic geometry on the one hand, and combinatorics and representation theory on the other. The examples come largely from the symplectic category, with particular attention to toric varieties. In the spirit of the 2006 International Conference on Toric Topology at Osaka City University, the main goal of this exposition is to exhibit toric techniques that arise in symplectic geometry.},

  abstract = {When geometric quantization is applied to a manifold using a real polarization which is "nice enough", a result of Sniatycki says that the quantization can be found by counting certain objects, called Bohr-Sommerfeld leaves. Subsequently, several authors have taken this as motivation for counting Bohr-Sommerfeld leaves when studying the quantization of manifolds which are less "nice". In this paper, we examine the quantization of compact symplectic manifolds that can locally be modelled by a toric manifold, using a real polarization modelled on fibres of the moment map. We compute the results directly, and obtain a theorem similar to Sniatycki's, which gives the quantization in terms of counting Bohr-Sommerfeld leaves. However, the count does not include the Bohr-Sommerfeld leaves which are singular. Thus the quantization obtained is different from the quantization obtained using a Kaehler polarization.},

Almost without exception, this book is about precise concepts and exact results in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics. The structural properties of mechanics are discussed independent of computational techniques for obtaining quantitatively correct numbers from the assumptions made. The standard approximation machinery for calculating from first principles explicit thermodynamic properties of materials, or explicit cross sections for high energy experiments can be found in many textbooks and is not repeated here.},

The traditional formulation of quantum mechanics is linear and algebraic. In contrast classical mechanics is a geometrical and non-linear theory that is defined on a symplectic manifold. However, after invention of general relativity, we are convinced that geometry is physical and effect us in all scale. Hence the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics sought to give a unified picture of physical systems based on its underling geometrical structures, e.g., now, the states are represented by points of a symplectic manifold with a compatible Riemannian metric, the observables are real-valued functions on the manifold, and the quantum evolution is governed by a symplectic flow that is generated by a Hamiltonian function. In this work we will give a compact introduction to main ideas of geometric formulation of quantum mechanics. We will provide the reader with the details of geometrical structures of both pure and mixed quantum states. We will also discuss and review some important applications of geometric quantum mechanics.},

string theory. First, the notion of a top was introduced by Candelas and Font
as a useful tool to investigate string dualities. These objects torically
encode the local geometry of a degeneration of an elliptic fibration. We
classify all tops and give a prescription for assigning an affine, possibly
twisted Kac-Moody algebra to any such top. Tops related to twisted Kac-Moody
algebras can be used to construct string compactifications with reduced rank of
the gauge group. Secondly, we compute all loop closed and open topological
string amplitudes on orientifolds of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, by using
geometric transitions involving SO/Sp Chern-Simons theory, localization on the
moduli space of holomorphic maps with involution, and the topological vertex.
In particular, we count Klein bottles and projective planes with any number of
handles in some Calabi-Yau orientifolds. We determine the BPS structure of the
amplitudes, and illustrate our general results in various examples with and
without D-branes. We also present an application of our results to the BPS
structure of the coloured Kauffman polynomial of knots.

Our aim is to provide a unified treatment of these two previously studied examples, with specific attention to the geometry and topology of the circle action on M that descends from the scalar action on the fibers of the cotangent bundle. We provide a detailed study of this action in the cases where M is a hypertoric variety or a hyperpolygon space. Most of this document consists of material from the papers math.DG/0207012, math.AG/0308218, and math.SG/0310141. Sections 2.2 and 3.5 contain previously unannounced results.},

If n and d are coprime it is in fact a K\textbackslash{}"ahler manifold. One may relax the constraint and study moduli spaces M(L) parametrizing those representations for which the loop around the boundary is sent to an element conjugate to L, if L is some element in SU(n), and these are also K\textbackslash{}"ahler manifolds for a suitable class of L. The Verlinde formula calculates the dimension of the space of holomorphic sections of certain line bundles over the spaces M(n,d) and M(L). We recall how a new proof of the Verlinde formula for M(n,d) given in joint work with Frances Kirwan may be obtained, and show how to modify this proof to obtain a proof of the variant of the Verlinde formula which applies to M(L) (the moduli space of parabolic bundles with one marked point) and to the analogous object with b marked points.},

Let \$v:M --{$>$} Lie(G)\$ be an equivariant map, such that the corresponding vector field on \$M\$ does not vanish outside of a compact subset. These data define an element of \$K\$-theory of the transversal cotangent bundle to \$M\$. Hence a topological index of the pair \$(D,v)\$ is defined as an element of the completed ring of characters of \$G\$. We define an analytic index of \$(D,v)\$ as an index space of certain deformation of \$D\$ and we prove that the analytic and topological indexes coincide. As a main step of the proof, we show that index is an invariant of a certain class of cobordisms, similar to the one considered by Ginzburg, Guillemin and Karshon. In particular, this means that the topological index of Atiyah is also invariant under this class of non-compact cobordisms. As an application we extend the Atiyah-Segal-Singer equivariant index theorem to our non-compact setting. In particular, we obtain a new proof of this theorem for compact manifolds.},

The dissertation gives a description of the topology and symplectic and algebraic geometry of Hitchin's hyperkaehler moduli space M of rank 2 Higgs bundles with fixed determinant of odd degree over a fixed Riemann surface. After the long introduction it describes a compactification of M in great detail, using symplectic cutting (math.AG/9804083). Examining the downward Morse flow of a natural circle action on M it shows the vanishing of intersection numbers (math.AG/9805071). Examining the upward Morse flow it explains a set of generators of the cohomology ring and a conjectured explicit description of the cohomology ring (which was proven in math.AG/0003094). Then finally it introduces the resolution tower for M, and shows that its direct limit is homotopically equivalent with the classifying space of the gauge group. In turn it yields another proof of the generation theorem (as in math.AG/0003093) and also yields a purely algebraic geometric proof of the Mumford conjecture about the cohomology ring of the moduli space of rank 2 stable bundles on curves. It finishes by proving homotopy stabilizations in the resolution tower analogously to the Atiyah-Jones conjecture.},

The framework is a detailed study of semi-projective toric varieties, meaning GIT quotients of affine spaces by torus actions, and specifically, of Lawrence toric varieties, meaning GIT quotients of even-dimensional affine spaces by symplectic torus actions. A toric hyperka¨hler variety is a complete intersection in a Lawrence toric variety. Both varieties are non-compact, and they share the same cohomology ring, namely, the Stanley-Reisner ring of a matroid modulo a linear system of parameters. Familiar applications of toric geometry to combinatorics, including the Hard Lefschetz Theorem and the volume polynomials of Khovanskii-Pukhlikov [11], are extended to the hyperka¨hler setting. When the matroid is graphic, our construction gives the toric quiver varieties, in the sense of Nakajima [17].},

This system involves a connection over a vector bundle, another connection over a line bundle, and a Higgs field. It appears naturally as a moment map equation in an analogous way to the Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation. This system is also a dimensional reduction of the Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation. Thus as above we may prove the existence of solutions and describe the moduli space. The stability condition for the existence of solutions is related to the notion of \textbackslash{}tau\textbackslash{}tau-stability introduced by Bradlow in connection with the vortex equation on a vector bundle.Finally, we consider the Fourier transform for bundles, connections and Higgs fields over an elliptic curve T. We define a transform and inversion formula for connections with constant central curvature, and also for pairs (\textbackslash{}varepsilon,\textbackslash{}phi)(\textbackslash{}varepsilon,\textbackslash{}phi) where \textbackslash{}varepsilon\textbackslash{}varepsilon is an indecomposable holomorphic vector bundle and \textbackslash{}phi\textbackslash{}phi is a holomorphic section. We discuss the extension of these ideas to a Riemann surface of genus {$>>$}1.

Using Morse theory, the moduli space of parabolic Higgs bundles is shown to be a non-compact, connected, simply connected manifold, and a computation of its Poincar\textbackslash{}'e polynomial is given.},

Our motivation is twofold. First, the category of orbifolds is important in symplectic geometry because, generically, the symplectic quotient of a symplectic manifold is an orbifold. Second, our proof is conceptually very simple since it reduces the non-abelian case to the abelian case.},

It aims to give the student a lift up into the subject at the research level, with lots of interesting topics taken from the classification of surfaces, and a human-oriented discussion of some of the technical foundations, but with no pretence at an exhaustive treatment. The early chapters introduce topics that are useful throughout projective and algebraic geometry, make little demands, and lead to fun calculations. The intermediate chapters introduce elements of the technical language gradually, whereas the later chapters get into the substance of the classification of surfaces. Special features include the theory of minimal models of surfaces via Mori theory, a complete selfcontained proof of the theorems on classification of surfaces, and a clean treatment of the foundational results on rational and elliptic Gorenstein surface singularities.

These quadrics are produced using a generalization of the Moore matrices which yields a uniform description of these ideals. We prove that these equations generate the ideals using a degeneration argument, degenerating abelian surfaces to schemes obtained from Stanley-Reisner ideals of certain triangulations of the torus. Furthermore, we obtain information on how to compute the moduli spaces of abelian surfaces of type (1,n) with canonical level structure. In a sequel to this paper, we will study the structure of the equations for n{$<$}=9, and also give detailed geometric descriptions for the moduli spaces of abelian surfaces of low degree.},

  abstract = {A theorem of Guillemin and Sternberg about geometric quantization of Hamiltonian actions of compact Lie groups G on compact Kähler manifolds says that the dimension of the G-invariant subspace is equal to the Riemann-Roch number of the symplectic quotient. Combined with the shifting-trick, this gives explicit formulas for the multiplicities of the various irreducible components. One of the assumptions of the theorem is that the reduction is regular, so that the reduced space is a smooth symplectic manifold. In this paper, we prove a generalization of this result to the case where the reduced space may have orbifold singularities. The result extends to non-Kählerian settings, if one defines the representation by the equivariant index of the \$\textbackslash{}text\{Spin\}\^\{c\}\textbackslash{}text\{-Dirac\}\$ operator associated to the quantizing line bundle.},

  title = {The {{Many Aspects}} of {{Counting Lattice Points}} in {{Polytopes}}},
  abstract = {A wide variety of topics in pure and applied mathematics involve the problem of counting the number of lattice points inside a convex bounded polyhedron, for short called a polytope. Applications range from the very pure (number theory, toric Hilbert functions, Kostant’s partition function in representation theory) to the most applied (cryptography, integer programming, contingency tables). This paper is a survey of this problem and its applications. We review the basic structure theorems about this type of counting problem. Perhaps the most famous special case is the theory of Ehrhart polynomials, introduced in the 1960s by Eug`ene Ehrhart. These polynomials count the number of lattice points in the different integral dilations of an integral convex polytope. We discuss recent algorithmic solutions to this problem and conclude with a look at what happens when trying to count lattice points in more complicated regions of space.},

The answer will be that if we give the algebra extension in theform of a left invariant dosed 2-form w on the Lie group, then there exists an associated group extension iff the group of periods of c\textasciitilde,is a discrete subgroup of JR and w admits a momentum mapping for the left action of thegroup on itself The second theme concerns the process of pre-quantization; we show that the construction needed to answer the previous question is exactly the same as the construction of prequantum bundles in geometric quantization. Moreover we show that the formalism of prequantization over a symplectic manifold and the formalism of quantum mechanics (where the projective Hi/bert spaces replaces the (symplectic) phase space) can be identified (modulo some (details, concerning infinite dimensions).},

  abstract = {In this paper we prove that the Todd class of a simplicial toric variety has a canonical expression as a power series in the torus-invariant divisors. Given a resolution of singularities corresponding to a nonsingular subdivision of the fan, we give an explicit formula for this power series which yields the Todd class. The computational feasibility of this procedure is implied by the additional fact that the above formula is compatible with Barvinok decompositions (virtual subdivisions) of the cones in the fan. In particular, this gives an algorithm for determining the coefficients of the Todd class in polynomial time for fixed dimension. We use this to give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the number of lattice points in a simple lattice polytope of fixed dimension, a result first achieved by Barvinok. @ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

We implement this method for the ADHM construction of the moduli spaces of framed Yang-Mills instantons on R4R4\{\textbackslash{}mathbb\{R\}\^\{4\}\} and rederive the formulas for the equivariant volumes obtained earlier by Nekrasov-Shadchin, expressing these volumes as iterated residues of a single rational function.},

Using this new description, we discuss their topology, completeness and isometries. We construct the moduli space metrics in the limit when some monopoles become massless, which corresponds to non-maximal symmetry breaking of the gauge group. We also introduce a new family of HyperKa¨hler metrics which, depending on the “mass parameter” being positive or negative, tend to either the asymptotic metric on the moduli space of many SU (2) monopoles, or to previously unknown metrics. These new metrics are singular or complete depending on the particular choice of the level set of the moment map. The singular metrics are of relevance to the moduli spaces of vacua of three dimensional gauge theories for higher rank gauge groups. Finally, we make a few comments concerning the existence of closed or bound orbits on some of these manifolds and the integrability of the geodesic flow.},

Hitchin's integrable systems. Second, their Hodge numbers, again in a suitably

Moreover, we express the flip as the blow-up and blow-down of specific ideal sheaves, leading, under certain hypotheses, to a quite explicit description of the flip. We apply these ideas to various familiar moduli problems, recovering results of Kirwan, Boden-Hu, Bertram-Daskalopoulos-Wentworth, and the author. Along the way we display a chamber structure, following Duistermaat-Heckman, on the space of all linearizations. We also give a new, easy proof of the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition theorem.},

Â The application of an electric field leads to both a distortion of the blue phase and to textural transitions, both of which we simulate numerically in good agreement with experiments, reproducing the blue phase X transition observed in the 1980s, but not identified theoretically.Â Finally, we show that blue phases extend beyond their traditional chiral setting and also occur in achiral nematics under strong flexoelectric coupling.

At the small length scales relevant to microscopic bacteria viscous stresses dominate over the effects of inertia and propulsion is achieved by quite different means to macroscopic organisms.Â We describe in detail the hydrodynamics of a simple model linked-sphere swimmer, with an emphasis on the interactions between swimmers.Â Time reversal symmetry is important, constraining both the locomotion of individuals and the nature of their interactions.Â We take this up with two examples: the hydrodynamic scattering of two swimmers, related to each other by time reversal, is shown to itself be time reversal covariant; the initial configuration being recovered exactly in the final state.Â Finally, a model of simple dumb-bells is described.Â Each swimmer is time reversal invariant and does not swim, but collective locomotion is still possible through hydrodynamic interactions, leading to a minimal description of active apolar fluids.},

This class plays an intriguing role in mirror theorems for Calabi-Yau orbifolds and in the deformation theory of these orbifolds. In the first part of the paper, we suppose that X is a complex torus with a holomorphic n-form ΩX, and that π : X → Tn is a fibration by special Lagrangian tori. If G is a finite group acting on X preserving the complex structure, ΩX, and the fibration, we construct an inner local system ρ arising from discrete torsion and a mirror map T on cohomology so that for any local system β, T is a mirror isomorphism on the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology, T : [special characters omitted](X,G)[special characters omitted](X,G). In the second part of the paper, we restrict to abelian G. In this setting, we describe a map from the twisted orbifold cohomology group [special characters omitted](X,G) to the first order deformation space of the underlying scheme of X/G. The deformations encoded in this group deform codimension 2 fixed-point sets of X/G, but leave fixed the support of the discrete torsion.},

We observe that category \$\textbackslash{}mathcal O\$ is often Koszul, and its Koszul dual is often equivalent to category \$\textbackslash{}mathcal O\$ for a different symplectic resolution. This leads us to define the notion of a symplectic duality between symplectic resolutions, which is a collection of isomorphisms between representation theoretic and geometric structures, including a Koszul duality between the two categories. This duality has various cohomological consequences, including (conjecturally) an identification of two geometric realizations, due to Nakajima and Ginzburg/Mirkovi\textbackslash{}'c-Vilonen, of weight spaces of simple representations of simply-laced simple algebraic groups. An appendix by Ivan Losev establishes a key step in the proof that \$\textbackslash{}mathcal O\$ is highest weight.},

Toric fiber products generalize familiar constructions in commutative algebra like adding monomial ideals and the Segre product.

  abstract = {The toric fiber product is an operation that combines two ideals that are homogeneous with respect to a grading by an affine monoid. The Segre product is a related construction that combines two multigraded rings. The quotient ring by a toric fiber product of two ideals is a subring of the Segre product, but in general this inclusion is strict. We contrast the two constructions and show that any Segre product can be presented as a toric fiber product without changing the involved quotient rings. This allows to apply previous results about toric fiber products to the study of Segre products. We give criteria for the Segre product of two affine toric varieties to be dense in their toric fiber product, and for the map from the Segre product to the toric fiber product to be finite. We give an example that shows that the quotient ring of a toric fiber product of normal ideals need not be normal. In rings with Veronese type gradings, we find examples of toric fiber products that are always Segre products, and we show that iterated toric fiber products of Veronese ideals over Veronese rings are normal.},
